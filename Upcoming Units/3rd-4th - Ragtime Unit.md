| Method               | Use the Maple Leaf Rag video to get accustomed to the feel of ragtime and provide a challenge for keeping up with the movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                          |
| Warm-up              | To introduce syncopation, clap a steady beat and have the class follow. Sing [[Punchinello]] and ask what they notice about the rhythm. Go through it a few times and have them sing with me. Explain syncopation as rhythms that don't fall on the steady beat. Further illustrate by stomping the steady beat and clapping the rhythm. Ask students to keep track of how many times I clap when my foot is up. |                                                                                                                          |
| Execution            | Watch the dynamic doodle video of Scott Joplin's life to introduce the class to ragtime. One of ragtime's characteristics is syncopation. For the body percussion video, start off by just listening to the song, then just clapping the rhythms, then doing all of the body percussion parts to the whole thing.                                                                                                | Dynamic doodle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah7rgJGBvs Body percussion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwWAE8UyMc |
