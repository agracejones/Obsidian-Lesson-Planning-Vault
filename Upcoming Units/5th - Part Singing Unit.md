| Method               | Use the song [[I Am Getting Such A Headache]] to get them used to singing independently of a different part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://musicplayonline.com/songs/i-am-getting-such-a-headache/?my_access                                                                                                                               |
| Warm-up              | Warm up by singing [[My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean]] and having them squat/stand every time I sing a word starting with the letter B. Do it twice, faster the second time. Then have them sing it for an extra challenge to pay attention while singing. This will prep them for the Do-La interval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Execution            | Challenge the class to sight read the Headache slide first without hearing it. They will struggle with the jump, so tell them it's the same interval (distance between notes) as the first two notes of My Bonnie. They will also struggle with low la and ti, so tell them they can use the chart at the top right of the slide. After they've sight read it to the best of their ability, sing the song with piano at quarter note speed. Have them copy each line after me, then sing the whole thing together. Bring it up to eighth note speed and sing again. Split the class and challenge them to sing it all together. | https://musicplayonline.com/songs/i-am-getting-such-a-headache/?my_access_code=S886743&modal=concept-https-musicplayonline-com-activities-library-grade-5-i-am-getting-such-a-headache-plain-notation-7 |

| Method               | Review [[I Am Getting Such A Headache]] and then learn [[When The Saints Go Marching In]] and [[She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://musicplayonline.com/songs/i-am-getting-such-a-headache/?my_access |
| Warm-up              | Warm up with [[My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean]], having them both sing and do the game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                           |
| Execution            | Sing through [[I Am Getting Such A Headache]] slowly, doing each part once separately, then adding them together twice, switching parts on the second time through. Then do it with the recording. Have them sight read through [[When The Saints Go Marching In]] without having the words, just singing on "la." Sing through it as a class, repeating lines when needed depending on how many already know it. Do the same thing with [[She'll Be Coming 'Round The Mountain]]. Then sing them in partner song form. |                                                                           |
