| Method               | Use the Maple Leaf Rag video to get accustomed to the feel of ragtime and provide a challenge for keeping up with the movements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                          |
| Warm-up              | To introduce syncopation, clap a steady beat and have the class follow. Sing [[Punchinello]] and ask what they notice about the rhythm. Go through it a few times and have them sing with me. Explain syncopation as rhythms that don't fall on the steady beat. Further illustrate by stomping the steady beat and clapping the rhythm. Ask students to keep track of how many times I clap when my foot is up. | https://musicplayonline.com/songs/punchinello/?my_access_code=S886                                                       |
| Execution            | Watch the dynamic doodle video of Scott Joplin's life to introduce the class to ragtime. One of ragtime's characteristics is syncopation. For the body percussion video, start off by just listening to the song, then just clapping the rhythms, then doing all of the body percussion parts to the whole thing.                                                                                                | Dynamic doodle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ah7rgJGBvs Body percussion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwwWAE8UyMc |

| Williams 2-25-26 | Not sure the big picture fully came into focus. Syncopation is such a vague and nebulous thing to describe to third graders!                                       |
| Pratt 2-25-26    | They were super talkative but the teaching went way better than Williams' class! I drew out the 1+2+... beats on the board and that really helped as a visual aid. |
| Sparks 2-26-26   | We actually ended early so we did a boomwhacker video of the entertainer.                                                                                          |

| Method               | Use the song [[Syncocopation]] to practice singing syncopated rhythms and then practice reading them by playing [[Steal the Bacon]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Warm-up              | Do the note name challenge for the song [[Syncocopation]]. Sing through the melody a few times on a neutral syllable once it is filled out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://musicplayonline.com/songs/syncocopation/?my_access_code=S886743&modal=interactive-https-musicplayonline-com-activities-solfa__note-activities-note_activities-exercises-04023_syncocopation-syncocopation-html-2 |
| Execution            | Add the lyrics to the [[Syncocopation]] ostinato and have the students clap on beats 2 and 4. Then introduce the "harmony" ostinato. Have all the students sing it together several times, still clapping. Now divide the class in half and assign one group to sing each ostinato. Sing separately before adding them together.<br>To play [[Steal the Bacon]], keep the two groups separate and assign each student a number (both groups should have the same numbers. If there is an uneven number, pick one student to help pick the rhythms for each round.) Have each group sit on opposite sides of the carpet with the "bacon" rhythm cards set out in the middle. First clap a rhythm, then call out a number. Each student with that number needs to go into the middle to find the corresponding card, check it with me, and bring it back to their team if it's correct. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
