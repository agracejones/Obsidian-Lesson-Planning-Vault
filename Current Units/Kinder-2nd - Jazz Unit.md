Blues is a style of music where people sing about things that make them sad with a slow, repeating musical background.                                                                                                              | 3 minutes  |

Jazz is a style where people experiment with music and improvise different parts to make the song different every time. Jazz uses a lot of different instruments. Keep an eye out to see what jazz instruments you see in this book! | 10 minutes |

| Movement for Form and Expression | [[Play Me a Jazzy Beat]] Beat variation                               | We are going to take turns improvising a rhythm with body percussion! We will stand in a circle and clap the steady beat as I sing the song, then whoever I stop behind gets to improvise their own beat! We will all copy them. Sit down once you've done it so I know who hasn't had a turn.    | 5 minutes  |

| Edmiston 2-12 | I need to switch up the order; the song followed by the book followed by the video was too much sitting! Also instead of improvising a rhythm, I think just picking a way to keep a steady beat would be better. |
