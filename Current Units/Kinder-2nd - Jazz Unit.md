| Pitch Exploration                | QOTD: What is your favorite instrument?                               | Sing the question and have them take turns answering in a singing voice.                                                                                                                                                                                                | 3 minutes  |
| Song Fragment                    | [[Oh My, No More Pie]] (with 12 bar blues ukulele, sing in AAB form.) | Introduce it as a song we've done before, but in a new style. Blues is a style of music where people sing about things that make them sad with a slow, repeating musical background.                                                                                    | 3 minutes  |
| Short Song                       | Watch Trombone Shorty video (up through his solo)                     | We are also going to learn about a type of music called jazz. Introduce the idea of improvisation, or making things up on the spot. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9YUi3UhEPQ                                                                                         | 4 minutes  |
| Movement for Form and Expression | [[Play Me a Jazzy Beat]] Beat variation                               | We are going to take turns improvising a rhythm with body percussion! We will stand in a circle and clap the steady beat as I sing the song, then whoever I stop behind gets to improvise their own beat! Sit down once you've done it so I know who hasn't had a turn. | 5 minutes  |

| Edmiston 2-12-26 | I need to switch up the order; the song followed by the book followed by the video was too much sitting! Also instead of improvising a rhythm, I think just picking a way to keep a steady beat would be better. |
| Alverson 2-20-26 | Went really well and the timing worked out perfectly!                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bliven 2-23-26   | They were super loud and we only got through the video. Next time I will skip the story and just do the Play Me A Beat instead of the song variation.                                                            |

| Edmiston 2-24-2026 | Ended up doing the Danny Go after QOTD because they had a lot of energy and it gave them a familiar frame of reference. We still had time for everything! I did the beat variation of the song again, though. |
