| **General Thoughts** | Busy day, kinda stressful. I'm still getting over being sick and I had to take over Mrs. Sparks' class for most of the day when I wasn't teaching music.                                                                                                                  | Awful ear infection and low energy. Bleh. I have a lot to do but don't know where to start. I'm hoping tomorrow my ear will be better and I can get more done!                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                          |          |        |

| Alverson             |        |         |           |          | They did great on the first [[Kinder-2nd - Jazz Unit\|jazz lesson]]! The pacing was much better than when I taught it to Edmiston's class. My voice is pretty weak, though, so it was a struggle.                                                              |

| Chuprova             |        |         |           |          | I didn't have the voice or energy to do the [[Kinder-2nd - Jazz Unit\|jazz]] lesson, so we did [[Movement Exploration]] with scarves and listened to different pieces of music instead. It worked out pretty well, but they had a lot of energy that I didn't. |

| Greene               |        |         |           |          | We tried the [[Movement Exploration]] with scarves, but they were too rowdy and unsafe with them. So instead I panicked and showed them a video of an orchestra instead because I had no backup to my backup plan.                                             |
| Lowry                |        |         |           |          | I didn't have enough voice or energy to start the [[5th - Part Singing Unit\|part singing]] lesson yet, so we played [[Four Corners]] and [[Beat Leader]] instead. They were pure chaos today.                                                                 |
| Pratt                |        |         |           |          | We did a [[Boomwhacker]] fun day and played a "guess-the-movie" game and did a few random songs.                                                                                                                                                               |

| **General Thoughts** |        |         |           |          | For being gone all week, I sure do feel like I've had a week's worth of exhaustion and chaos! They definitely kept me on my toes today. I need to actually plan out the rest of my units so I feel fully prepared for the next couple of weeks.                |
