| Alverson         |        |         |           |          | They did great on the first [[Kinder-2nd - Jazz Unit\|jazz lesson]]! The pacing was much better than when I taught it to Edmiston's class. My voice is pretty weak, though, so it was a struggle.                                     |

| Chuprova         |        |         |           |          | I didn't have the voice or energy to do the [[Kinder-2nd - Jazz Unit\|jazz]] lesson, so we did [[]] scarves and listened to different pieces of music instead. It worked out pretty well, but they had a lot of energy that I didn't. |
