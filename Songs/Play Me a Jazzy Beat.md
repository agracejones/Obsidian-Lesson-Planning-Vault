## Lyrics
Play me a fun little jazzy beat
You can clap your hands,
You can stomp your feet
Making up songs is such a treat
With you!
Doo, doo bee doo
## Variations/Modifications
#### Song variation (for scat singing)
Sing me a fun little jazzy song
You can sing anything
And it won't be wrong!
Your notes can be short,
Or they can be long,
You choose!
Doo, doo bee doo

#### Tune variation (for kazoo improvisation)
Play me a fun little jazzy tune
If you haven't had a turn,
You will get one soon!
'Cause nothing says jazz
Like an afternoon kazoo!
Doo, doo bee doo
## Other Notes

Song follows a CMaj7/A7/D7/G7 ukulele chord progression. Alternate verses and improvisation times of the same length, having students stand in a circle while I walk around behind them. Whoever I am standing behind when I finish singing will get to improvise a beat, scat, or kazoo tune, then sit down.
