## Lyrics
Oh, my!
No more pie.
Pie's too sweet,
I want a piece of meat.
Meat's too red,
I want a piece of bread.
Bread's too brown,
I think I'll go to town.
Town's too far,
I think I'll take a car.
Car won't go,
I fell and stubbed my toe.
Toe gives me pain,
I think I'll take the train.
Train had a wreck,
I fell and hurt my neck.
Oh, my!
No more pie.
## Variations/Modifications
#### Twelve Bar Blues version

Sing with a 12BB chord progression in an AAB format. (Oh my, no more pie/I said oh my, no more pie/pie's too sweet, I want a piece of meat, etc.)
